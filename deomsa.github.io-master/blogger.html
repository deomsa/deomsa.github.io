I think you woke up the dead with that blast. Take this camera... I want to document everything! (Delgato Mine - Inside) (Doc and Marty are using flashlights to try and find the spot where the Delorean is buried.) This reminds me of the time I attempted to reach the center of the earth. I'd be reading my favorite author, Jules Verne. I spent weeks preparing for the expedition, I didn't even get this far. Of course, I was only 12 at the time. It was the writings of Jules Verne that had a profound effect on my life. I was 11 when I first read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. That's when I realized that I must devote my life into science.</p>
